# Go Agent Framework Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Framework (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Basic agent structure
- ✅ Task processing mechanism
- ✅ LLM integration (mock implementations)
- ✅ Tool interface and registry
- ✅ Simple memory system

## Phase 2: Enhancements (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Workflow engine with step execution
- ✅ Enhanced vector search with cosine similarity
- ✅ Team coordination patterns (parallel, sequential, orchestrator)
- ✅ Memory operations for shared state
- ⬜ Proper connection between workflow and scheduler
- ⬜ Tool execution chain

## Phase 3: LLM Integration (TODO)
- ⬜ Anthropic API integration
  - Add Anthropic Go SDK dependency
  - Implement actual API calls
  - Add proper error handling and rate limiting
- ⬜ OpenAI API integration
  - Add OpenAI Go SDK dependency
  - Implement actual API calls
  - Add proper error handling and rate limiting
- ⬜ Tool calling loop implementation
  - Implement proper tool execution with LLM-requested calls
  - Add result formatting and retry mechanisms

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (TODO)
- ⬜ Real vector embeddings
  - Add embedding model integration
  - Implement efficient vector search
- ⬜ Persistent storage options
  - Add database adapters (PostgreSQL, Redis)
  - Implement serialization/deserialization
- ⬜ Distributed execution
  - Add message queue integration
  - Implement agent workers across nodes
- ⬜ Enhanced monitoring and observability
  - Add OpenTelemetry integration
  - Implement logging and metrics

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (TODO)
- ⬜ Comprehensive testing
  - Unit tests for all components
  - Integration tests for workflows
  - Benchmarks for performance
- ⬜ Documentation
  - API documentation
  - Usage examples
  - Architecture diagrams
- ⬜ Security hardening
  - API key management
  - Rate limiting
  - Input validation
- ⬜ Performance optimization
  - Connection pooling
  - Caching mechanisms
  - Resource usage optimizations

## Next Immediate Steps:
1. Complete the integration between workflow engine and runtime/scheduler
2. Implement actual LLM API calls for Anthropic and OpenAI
3. Add real embedding model integration for memory system
4. Create more comprehensive example applications
5. Add proper error handling and retries for external API calls
